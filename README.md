# fetcher
Script for getting user-info with access token from vk.com
It gets users from Sverdlovsk region(can be modified) and saves user info, user's friends and user's groups to json file.

Should be remade into 3 scripts for getting info about ALL users in Sverdlovsk region, their groups, friends(other requests if necessary) and saving it to local db.
